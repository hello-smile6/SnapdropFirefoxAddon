# Snapdrop Web Extension (Addon)
Share files between devices in your local network.

## Description
By default, this addon just displays a <b>popup</b> with the <a href="https://Snapdrop.net/" target="_blank">Snapdrop</a> website so you can start recieving files and texts easily. In the Popup the URL of the current Tab is posted to the Message Dialog (right click).

<b>Background mode</b>
<br>
<i>can be enabled in the settings</i>
<br>
This runs Snapdrop in the background so you can send files/texts anytime and get notifications. If you click on the icon, Snapdrop is opened so you can also send.

ATTENTION:
make sure that Snapdrop is only running once.
(The background service will stop working if Snapdrop is opened in any tab, just make sure not to open Snapdrop in several tabs)
